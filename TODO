* clean up getAccountId. Right now, it's very messy, because of the hacky way in which i added ACCT.MIGRATE
* clean up relation between Accounts and Security. Since Security should be able to respond with a redirect, it should include at least the emigrants table. Then Accounts should probably not access Storage directly.
* unit tests for ACCT.MIGRATE
* acceptance tests and/or testing with loginapp.
* make loginapp work with newest email-based arch.
* wrap up and deliver
